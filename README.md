# Grade-Calculator
The project serves as a grade point average (GPA) calculator to determine a final letter grade output
Serves as a personal project to make calculating my class grade easier


# Features to add
In the future I'd like to expand this assignment to be able to determine the amount of assignments to find the weights 
Add a feature to calculate the remaining percentage with respect to the difference ie. grade without a 30% final exam
Note: A simple input statement paired with a variable i would suffice for this issue


# Compiling 
Seeing as the majority of the code was done on the Zeus virtual machine alternative such as GDB online could be helpful
Simply running the code in the terminal would suffice


# User input
The code specifically asks for a floating point value for the weighted percentages of each class (totaling up to 100)
The user will then be asked to enter the grade for each assignment
Example: Enter your lab grade: "75"

The process will repeat until the total amount of assignments is reached at which point a grade average is printed
A double rounded to the nearest hundreth is printed as well as its respective letter grade
Note: Assumes standard 4.0 grading scale as well | F > 60, D > 70 ... A < 90|
